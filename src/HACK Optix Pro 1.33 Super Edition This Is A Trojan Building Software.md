How to Prevent a RAT Infection
 
As you can see, HACK Optix Pro 1.33 Super Edition is a very dangerous malware that can compromise your privacy and security. Therefore, it is essential to prevent a RAT infection from happening in the first place. Here are some tips on how to protect your computer from RATs:

1. Avoid downloading files from unreliable sources. These malicious files can carry certain malware in them, including a RAT[^2^]. Also, make it a habit to not open email attachments from unknown users.
2. Use antivirus software. This can help you detect and remove a possible RAT from entering your system before it can even cause any major disruptions on your systemâs security[^3^]. Make sure to update your antivirus software regularly and perform scans frequently.
3. Enable your firewall. A firewall can block unauthorized network connections and prevent hackers from accessing your computer remotely[^2^]. You can use the built-in firewall of your operating system or install a third-party firewall for extra protection.
4. Repair any cracks and fill any gaps in your system. To avoid visits from rats, mice and other rodents, inspect your system regularly for cracks and gaps around the foundation, doors and windows. Even small holes can provide a wide open door to ratsâthat have a way of squeezing through the slimmest of spacesâso fill in and make repairs where necessary[^1^].
5. Make your place minty fresh. Rats find mint almost as repugnant as humans find them. So try spraying some peppermint oil around your computer and its cables. This may deter rats from chewing on them and causing damage[^1^].
