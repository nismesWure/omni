SKIDROW is a notorious group of software crackers who have been active since 1990. They started out by cracking games for the Amiga platform, a popular home computer system at the time. They adopted the motto "Twice the Fun - Double the Trouble!" and have stuck with it ever since. In 1992, they released a cracktro software, which is a small program that runs before the cracked game, with the game 10 Pinball Fantasies. This cracktro software revealed the names of all the members of SKIDROW at that time.[33] After a long hiatus, SKIDROW re-emerged in June 2007 and announced their comeback to the cracking scene.[34] They made history by being the first scene group to crack Ubisoft's Uplay DRM, which was a controversial anti-piracy system that required players to be constantly online and connected to Ubisoft's licensing servers. They cracked this DRM in two games: Assassin's Creed II[35] and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands.

SKIDROW has been involved in several controversies and conflicts with other cracking groups and game developers. In 2010, they accused another group, RELOADED, of stealing their cracks and releasing them as their own. They also claimed that RELOADED was spreading false rumors about SKIDROW's members and methods.[36] In 2011, they had a feud with another group, Razor1911, over the game Crysis 2. SKIDROW released a cracked version of the game before its official release date, but Razor1911 claimed that it was a leaked beta version and not the final product. Razor1911 then released their own cracked version of the game after its official release and criticized SKIDROW for their poor quality and ethics.[37]
  
SKIDROW has also faced legal actions and threats from game developers and publishers who have tried to stop their activities and protect their intellectual property rights. In 2010, Ubisoft sued several individuals who were allegedly members of SKIDROW for distributing cracked copies of Assassin's Creed II. Ubisoft claimed that SKIDROW's crack caused significant financial losses and damaged the reputation of the game.[38] In 2012, Bethesda Softworks sent a cease and desist letter to SKIDROW for cracking their game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Bethesda argued that SKIDROW's crack violated their end-user license agreement and enabled players to access pirated downloadable content.[39]
  
Despite these challenges and risks, SKIDROW has continued to crack games and release them to the public. They have cracked games from various genres and platforms, such as action-adventure, role-playing, simulation, sports, racing, strategy, and virtual reality. Some of the games they have cracked include Grand Theft Auto V, Fallout 4, FIFA 21, Resident Evil Village, Cyberpunk 2077, and Half-Life: Alyx. They have also cracked games that use different types of DRM systems, such as Denuvo, Steamworks, SecuROM, StarForce, and Origin.[40]
