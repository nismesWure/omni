## What are the features of Bongo 2.0 for Rhinoceros 6 Win?
 
Bongo 2.0 for Rhinoceros 6 Win has many features that make it a powerful and versatile animation tool. Here are some of the main features:
 
- **Easy keyframe animation.** You can animate any object or camera in your scene by simply moving it to a desired position and setting a keyframe. You can then edit the keyframes in the timeline or the curve editor, and adjust the speed, acceleration, and easing of the animation.
- **Advanced expression animation.** You can animate any object or camera in your scene by using expressions that control the movement based on parameters such as time, distance, or angle. You can also use expressions to link objects together, such as making a wheel rotate when a car moves.
- **Physics-based simulation.** You can animate any object in your scene by using physics-based simulation that takes into account factors such as collisions, gravity, and wind. You can also apply forces and constraints to objects, such as springs, hinges, and motors.
- **IK (Inverse Kinematics) animation.** You can animate any object in your scene by using IK animation that allows you to move an object by manipulating its end point, rather than its origin point. This is useful for animating complex structures such as chains, ropes, or characters.
- **Morphing animation.** You can animate any object in your scene by using morphing animation that allows you to change its shape over time. You can use morphing animation to create effects such as deformation, transformation, or blending.
- **Rendering and exporting.** You can render and export your animations directly from Rhinoceros 6 Win, using its built-in render engine or any compatible third-party render engine. You can also export your animations to various formats such as AVI, MOV, MP4, or GIF.
