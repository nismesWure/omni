The answer is yes, but with some caveats. There are two main methods to get a free CyberGhost premium account: using a free trial or using a money-back guarantee. Let's take a look at each one.
 
## Using a Free Trial
 
CyberGhost offers a generous 24-hour free trial for its VPN service. You can access this trial by visiting [CyberGhost's website](https://my.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/login) and clicking on the "Start Free Trial" button. You will need to create an account with your email address and password, but you won't need to provide any payment information.
 
Once you sign up, you can download and install the CyberGhost app on your device of choice. You can use the VPN on up to seven devices simultaneously, and choose from over 8,900 servers in 110+ locations across 91 countries[^2^]. You can also enjoy features like kill switch, split tunneling, ad blocker, malware blocker, and more.
 
The free trial will give you full access to all the premium features of CyberGhost for 24 hours. However, after that period, you will need to upgrade to a paid plan or cancel your account. If you don't want to pay for CyberGhost, you can try another method: using a money-back guarantee.
 
## Using a Money-Back Guarantee
 
CyberGhost also offers a generous money-back guarantee for its paid plans. You can get a full refund within 14 days if you choose the monthly plan, or within 45 days if you choose the longer-term plans. This means that you can essentially use CyberGhost for free for up to 45 days, as long as you remember to cancel your subscription before the deadline.
 
To use this method, you will need to sign up for a paid plan on [CyberGhost's website](https://my.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/login). You will need to provide your payment information, but you won't be charged until the end of your trial period. You can choose from various payment methods, including credit cards, PayPal, Bitcoin, and more.
 
Once you sign up, you can download and install the CyberGhost app on your device of choice.

The money-back guarantee will give you full access to all the premium features of CyberGhost for up to 45 days. However, before that period ends, you will need to contact CyberGhost's customer support and request a refund. You can do this via live chat or email. You will need to provide your account details and the reason for your cancellation. CyberGhost will process your refund within 10 business days.
