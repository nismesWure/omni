Some of the main themes that Ashihara discusses in his book are the following:
 
- The difference between interior and exterior space. Ashihara defines interior space as the space enclosed by walls, roofs, and floors, and exterior space as the space outside of these boundaries. He argues that exterior space is not merely a leftover or a negative space, but a positive and active space that can be designed and manipulated.
- The concept of ma. Ashihara introduces the Japanese term ma, which means "space" or "interval", to describe the quality of exterior space. He explains that ma is not just a physical dimension, but a psychological and emotional one as well. He says that ma can create a sense of rhythm, balance, contrast, and tension in exterior space.
- The role of exterior space in urban design. Ashihara emphasizes the importance of exterior space in shaping the character and identity of a city. He suggests that exterior space can be used to create a sense of continuity and connection between different buildings and areas, as well as to express the culture and history of a place. He also proposes that exterior space can be used to solve some of the problems of modern urbanization, such as congestion, pollution, and alienation.

Exterior Design in Architecture is a classic and influential book in the field of architecture and urban design. It has inspired many architects and designers to rethink their approach to exterior space and to explore new possibilities for creating meaningful and beautiful environments.
