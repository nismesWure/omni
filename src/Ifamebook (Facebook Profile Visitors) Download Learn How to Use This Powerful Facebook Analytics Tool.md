## How to See Who Views Your Facebook Profile
  
Many Facebook users wonder if they can see who views their profile, especially if they have a lot of friends or followers. However, Facebook doesn't let people track who views their profile. Third-party apps also can't provide this functionality. If you come across an app that claims to offer this ability, please report the app as it might be a scam or a malware.
  
The only way to see who views your profile is to use the Stories feature on Facebook. Stories are short videos or photos that disappear after 24 hours. You can see how many people and who viewed your story by tapping on it and swiping up. However, this only shows you who viewed your story, not your entire profile.
  
If you want to see who views your profile more often, you can also check your friend list and see who appears first. Facebook's algorithm ranks your friends based on how often you interact with them, so the ones who appear first might be the ones who visit your profile more frequently. However, this is not a definitive or accurate way of knowing who views your profile.
