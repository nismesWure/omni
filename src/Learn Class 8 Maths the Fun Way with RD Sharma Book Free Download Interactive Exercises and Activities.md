# How to Download Eavp6 Encoder for Secure and Reliable Streaming
 
If you are looking for a way to stream live video and audio with ultra low latency and high quality, you might be interested in Eavp6 encoder. Eavp6 encoder is a software that uses the Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) protocol to transmit data over the internet. SRT is an open-source technology that encrypts, recovers, and adapts to changing network conditions. It is widely used by broadcasters, streamers, and content providers for contribution and distribution of live streams.
 
In this article, we will show you how to download Eavp6 encoder for your platform and how to use it to stream your content. We will also explain some of the features and benefits of using Eavp6 encoder and SRT protocol.

## What is Eavp6 Encoder?
 
Eavp6 encoder is a software that encodes video and audio data using various codecs and formats, such as H.264, HEVC, AAC, MP3, etc. It then sends the encoded data over the internet using SRT protocol. SRT protocol ensures that the data is secure, reliable, and fast. It also allows you to adjust the bitrate, latency, and quality of your stream according to your network conditions and preferences.
 
Eavp6 encoder is compatible with various platforms, such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android, iOS, etc. It also supports different input sources, such as webcam, microphone, screen capture, file playback, etc. You can use Eavp6 encoder to stream to any SRT-enabled destination, such as another Eavp6 encoder, an SRT server, or an SRT player.

## How to Download Eavp6 Encoder?
 
To download Eavp6 encoder for your platform, you need to visit the GitHub repository of Haivision/srt[^1^]. Haivision is the company that developed SRT protocol and provides various tools and resources for SRT users. On the GitHub page of Haivision/srt[^1^], you will find the source code of Eavp6 encoder under the apps folder. You can download the source code as a zip file or clone it using git.
 
After downloading the source code of Eavp6 encoder, you need to compile it using CMake. CMake is a cross-platform tool that generates build files for various compilers and environments. You can find the instructions on how to compile Eavp6 encoder using CMake on the README.md file of Haivision/srt[^1^]. You will also need some dependencies, such as libogg[^2^], libvorbis[^2^], libtheora[^2^], libspeex[^2^], libflac[^2^], etc. You can download these libraries from their respective websites or use a package manager to install them.
 
Once you have compiled Eavp6 encoder successfully, you will get an executable file named eavp6encoder in your build folder. You can run this file from your command line or terminal to start using Eavp6 encoder.
  
## How to Use Eavp6 Encoder?
 
To use Eavp6 encoder to stream your content, you need to specify some parameters on your command line or terminal. The basic syntax of Eavp6 encoder is:
 `eavp6encoder [options] input_url output_url` 
The input\_url is the source of your video and audio data. It can be a device name (such as webcam or microphone), a file name (such as mp4 or mp3), or a network address (such as udp or rtmp). The output\_url is the destination of your encoded data. It must be an SRT address with the format:
 `srt://host:port?streamid=stream_name` 
The host is the IP address or domain name of your SRT destination. The port is the port number of your SRT destination. The streamid is an optional parameter that identifies your stream on your SRT destination. The stream\_name is any name you want to give to your stream.
