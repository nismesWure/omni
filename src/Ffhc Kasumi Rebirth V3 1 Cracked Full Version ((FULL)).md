When I go to Help > Register... menu, I can see the current license information, but there is no option to delete it or to enter invalid data such as a nonexisting license server. How can I remove the license settings completely from IntelliJ?
  
The license settings are stored in a file called idea.key in the IntelliJ configuration directory. Depending on your operating system, the location of this directory may vary. For Windows, it is usually under %USERPROFILE%\.IntelliJIdea<version>\config. For Linux, it is usually under ~/.IntelliJIdea<version>/config. For Mac OS X, it is usually under ~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea<version>.</version></version></version>

To remove the license settings, you need to delete the idea.key file from the configuration directory. You can do this by using a file manager or a command line tool. After deleting the file, you need to restart IntelliJ for the changes to take effect. You will then be prompted to enter a new license key or choose a trial option.

Alternatively, you can use the JetBrains Toolbox app to manage your licenses for IntelliJ and other JetBrains products. The Toolbox app lets you easily switch between different licenses, activate and deactivate them, and renew them when they expire.
