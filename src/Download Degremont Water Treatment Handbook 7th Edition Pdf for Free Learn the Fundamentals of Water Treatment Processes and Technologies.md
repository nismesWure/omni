The Degremont Water Treatment Handbook is a reference work that covers the fundamental concepts and technologies of water treatment, as well as the solutions applied to different types of water use. The 7th edition, published in 2007, incorporates the major technological advances of the last 15 years, such as membrane separation, fixed and mixed cultures, sludge drying and incineration, and reduced sludge production. It also addresses the new challenges in water treatment, such as conservation of fresh water resources, health safety and waste management.

The handbook consists of two volumes and five chapters dedicated to treatment channels. The first volume covers the basic principles of water quality and treatment, the physical-chemical processes, the biological processes, and the separation processes. The second volume deals with the specific treatments for drinking water, process water, wastewater and sludge. The handbook aims to provide engineers with an everyday aid by summarising the basics in water treatment. It also reflects the expertise and know-how of Degremont, a leading company in water treatment solutions.

Water treatment is the process of improving the quality and safety of water for various purposes, such as drinking, industrial use, irrigation, recreation and environmental protection. Water treatment can involve physical, chemical, biological or thermal methods to remove contaminants and pathogens from water sources. Some of the common water treatment technologies are:
 
- **Granular activated carbon (GAC):** This is a porous adsorption media that can remove organic compounds, taste and odor, natural organic matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and disinfection byproduct precursors from water. GAC can be contained in pressure vessels or open concrete basins and can be regenerated or replaced when exhausted[^1^].
- **Packed tower aeration (PTA):** This is a process that transfers VOCs and other gases from water to air by forcing pressurized water through a column packed with inert materials. The air is then vented or treated before release. PTA can achieve high removal efficiencies for VOCs such as benzene, toluene and xylene[^1^].
- **Multi-stage bubble aeration (MSBA):** This is a process that transfers VOCs and other gases from water to air by injecting air bubbles into a series of tanks or basins. The air bubbles rise to the surface and carry the VOCs with them. The air is then vented or treated before release. MSBA can achieve moderate removal efficiencies for VOCs such as TCE and PCE[^1^].
- **Anion exchange:** This is a process that removes negatively charged ions (anions) such as nitrate, arsenate, perchlorate and fluoride from water by exchanging them with chloride or hydroxide ions on a resin bed. The resin bed can be regenerated with salt or caustic solutions when exhausted[^1^].
- **Cation exchange:** This is a process that removes positively charged ions (cations) such as calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese and radium from water by exchanging them with sodium or hydrogen ions on a resin bed. The resin bed can be regenerated with salt or acid solutions when exhausted[^1^].
- **Biological treatment:** This is a process that uses microorganisms to degrade organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus from water. Biological treatment can be aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (without oxygen) and can involve suspended or attached growth systems. Biological treatment can reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), ammonia, nitrate and phosphorus[^2^].
- **Reverse osmosis/nanofiltration:** These are membrane processes that separate dissolved solids, organic matter, microorganisms and other contaminants from water by applying pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane. Reverse osmosis can remove up to 99% of dissolved solids, while nanofiltration can remove up to 90%. These processes can produce high quality water for drinking, industrial use or reuse[^2^].
- **Nontreatment options:** These are alternatives to conventional water treatment that can reduce or eliminate the need for treatment. Nontreatment options include source water protection, blending, dilution, alternative water sources and point-of-use devices[^1^].

Water treatment technologies can be combined in different ways to achieve the desired water quality and quantity for various applications. The selection of the most appropriate technology depends on several factors, such as source water characteristics, treatment objectives, regulatory requirements, economic feasibility and environmental impacts.
