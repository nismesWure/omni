One of the Steamworks fixes that you can use is Nino23's fix, which is based on REVOLT's fix. This fix allows you to host and join servers that are compatible with Arma 3 Apex, the latest expansion of the game. To use this fix, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the fix from [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/5ydv1y/arma3apexsteamworksfixrevolt/).
2. Extract the contents of the archive to your Arma 3 installation folder, replacing any existing files.
3. Run Steam and log in with any account.
4. Run Arma3Launcher.exe from your Arma 3 installation folder.
5. Select the server browser tab and choose a server from the cracked master server list.
6. Click on join and enjoy playing Arma 3 multiplayer with your friends.

Note: To host a server, you will need to open port 2302 in your router/firewall. Your server will be visible in the cracked master server list and joinable by anyone who has the same fix as you.
